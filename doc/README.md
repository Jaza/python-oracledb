# python-oracledb Documentation Source

This directory contains the python-oracledb documentation source. It is written
using reST (re-Structured Text). The source files are processed using
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and can be turned into HTML, PDF or ePub
documentation.

**Visit https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/ for pre-built production and
development python-oracledb documentation**

## Building Documentation Locally

To build the documentation locally:

1. Install Sphinx and the Read the Docs theme using the Python package manager
   ``pip``, for example:

        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

   You can alternatively install these from pre-built packages for your
   operating system.

2. The "oracledb" module must be built and importable. This is needed for the
   "autodoc" extension to create function signature documentation.

3. Once Sphinx is installed, and "oracledb" can be imported by Python, use the
   Makefile to build your desired documentation format.

   To build the HTML documentation:

       make

   To make ePub documentation:

       make epub

   To make PDF documentation:

       make pdf

   The program ``latexmk`` may be required by Sphinx to generate PDF output.
