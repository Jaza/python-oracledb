          call will try to acquire a connection in the time specified by
          pool.wait_timeout and return an error if the time taken exceeds that
          value.

        * With mode :data:`~oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_WAIT`, an ``acquire()`` call
          will wait until after the pool has been reconfigured and a connection
          is available.

        * With mode :data:`~oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_NOWAIT`, if the number of
          busy connections is less than the pool size, ``acquire()`` will
          return a new connection after pool reconfiguration is complete.
